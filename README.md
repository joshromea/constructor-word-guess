# Dragon Ball word guess game

This program is a word guessing game that you play through Bash/Terminal. 

# How to play

You will need to clone this repo in your computer and enter `npm install`.

The game is a simple Hangman style game where the user enters what letter to guess. Each time a new round is started, the word will be represented by '_'. Each time a letter is guessed correctly, one of the '_' will change to the letter that was guessed. If the letter guessed is incorrect, nothing will change. On both instances, the Guesses left counter will decrement. The game is over when the user correctly guesses the word before running out of guesses or the player runs out of guesses.
